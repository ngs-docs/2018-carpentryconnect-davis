# CarpentryCon West Notes on Translation of The Carpentries (somos Carpinteros)

## Notes on the Content

We need to establish a framework to translate consistently any lesson.

We can start using an automatic translator such as https://www.matecat.com/ and decide on terminology/glossary to be used throughout the lesson. This keeps everything consistent and easier to follow.

In the lessons, provide a description in Spanish of what each function/argument means so that everyone can use the commands in a more intuitive way.

## Notes on the Outreach

We need a project manager to coordinate instructors.
Have regular meetings (~every 3-4 months?) where people are tasked to do something specific and decide on new plans/lessons/trainig?

Who is out there? How many workshops are planned? How can we increase the audience? (Twitter, allow for longer times).

Establish workshops in countries where the language is spoken.

## Instructor Training 

Can training for instructors be provided in Spanish? This is teacing how to teach and may be unaccessible to people with other mother tongue. 

## We need Documentation

So that everything that is built and updated- we can then all incorporate the changes and they don't 'die' on the way.

## Directionality

Changes in the English curriculum are incorporated into the Spanish curriculum.

Can changes in the Spanish curriculum be incorporated into the English one (maybe raising an Issue on GitHub)

## Plan of Action: Acción!

### Improve the Glossary
Turn the glossary into a csv

Point the Instructors to the Glossary

Add the side notes so that the learners have these in front of them during the lesson

### What we want to do

We will give a go to the Ecology Lesson in Data Carpentry- pilot!

Variable names changed into Spanish

### Community Involvement

Email the DC folks to tell them 'we are going to launch this'
Contact the Spanish Instructors to have a call together and decide how/who teaches. 

Git Hub Repo so that people have access to the lesson and have feedback
